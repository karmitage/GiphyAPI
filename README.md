# GiphyAPI

### This app uses the giphy library to display gifs associated with a mood. The app is initialized with an array of buttons for several moods. If the user clicks on a button, the app queries the Giphy API and retrieves ten gifs related to the button query. If the user clicks on a gif, it pauses, and if they click again, it resumes animation.

### Users can add their own mood buttons by typing a string into the submit form and clicking "add mood"

### I found this homework pretty straightforward. If I had more time I would change the html layout so that the gif results are displayed in a grid.
